# Implementation Plan for Cost Optimization

This document outlines an implementation plan for optimizing costs in an AWS environment. The plan focuses on enforcing resource tagging, automating cleanup tasks, managing budgets, and leveraging AWS tools and services for cost monitoring.

---

## 1. Enforce Resource Tagging Policies

### Why:
Tagging helps track and manage resources by owner, purpose, and environment.

### How:
Use AWS Tag Policies to enforce tagging standards.

### Steps:
1. Define mandatory tags like `Environment`, `Owner`, and `Project`.
2. Create a tagging policy using AWS Organizations.
3. Use scripts to audit and report non-compliant resources.

#### Script Example: Audit Untagged Resources
```bash
# List all EC2 instances and their tags
aws ec2 describe-instances --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].[InstanceId, Tags]' --output table
```

---

## 2. Automate Cleanup of Unused Resources

### Why:
Prevent costs from idle resources like EBS, ELB, or Elastic IPs.

### How:
Write and schedule cleanup scripts or use AWS Lambda functions.

#### Script Example: Delete Unused EBS Volumes
```bash
# Find and delete unattached EBS volumes
UNATTACHED_VOLUMES=$(aws ec2 describe-volumes \
    --filters Name=status,Values=available \
    --query 'Volumes[*].VolumeId' --output text)

for VOLUME in $UNATTACHED_VOLUMES; do
    echo "Deleting volume $VOLUME"
    aws ec2 delete-volume --volume-id "$VOLUME"
done
```

---

## 3. Set Up Budget Alerts

### Why:
Track costs and get notified when approaching limits.

### How:
Use AWS Budgets to set alerts for spending thresholds.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the AWS Budgets dashboard.
2. Create a budget for your account or specific services.
3. Set up email notifications.

---

## 4. Optimize EC2 Instances

### Why:
Identify and address underutilized or overprovisioned instances.

### How:
Use AWS Compute Optimizer or scripts.

#### Script Example: Find Underutilized Instances
```bash
# List instances with low CPU utilization (<10% over the last week)
aws cloudwatch get-metric-data \
    --metric-data-queries file://queries.json \
    --start-time $(date -d '-7 days' --utc +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ) \
    --end-time $(date --utc +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
```

---

## 5. Enable Lifecycle Policies

### Why:
Automatically delete old snapshots, logs, or S3 objects.

### How:
Use lifecycle policies in S3, CloudWatch, and EBS.

### Steps:
- **For S3:**
  1. Go to the S3 bucket.
  2. Configure a lifecycle rule to delete objects after X days.

- **For CloudWatch Logs:**
```bash
# Set log retention to 30 days
aws logs put-retention-policy \
    --log-group-name "my-log-group" \
    --retention-in-days 30
```

- **For EBS Snapshots:**
  Use AWS Backup to define lifecycle policies.

---

## 6. Monitor and Manage Costs with AWS Tools

### Why:
Get insights into cost and usage trends.

### How:
- Enable AWS Cost Explorer to analyze spending.
- Use AWS Trusted Advisor to identify cost optimization opportunities.
- Integrate with CloudWatch to monitor cost spikes.

---

## 7. Leverage Spot Instances and Savings Plans

### Why:
Reduce costs by using discounted compute resources.

### How:
Identify workloads suitable for spot instances or savings plans.

#### Script Example: Launch Spot Instances
```bash
aws ec2 request-spot-instances \
    --instance-count 1 \
    --type "one-time" \
    --launch-specification file://spot-config.json
```

---

## 8. Automate EKS Cluster Cleanup

### Why:
Avoid costs from idle Kubernetes clusters.

### How:
Use scripts to identify and delete unused clusters.

#### Script Example: Delete EKS Cluster
```bash
CLUSTER_NAME="my-cluster"
aws eks delete-cluster --name "$CLUSTER_NAME"
```

---

## 9. Detect and Remove Unused Elastic IPs

### Why:
Elastic IPs incur costs when not attached to instances.

#### Script Example:
```bash
# List and release unused Elastic IPs
UNUSED_IPS=$(aws ec2 describe-addresses \
    --query 'Addresses[?AssociationId==null].PublicIp' --output text)

for IP in $UNUSED_IPS; do
    echo "Releasing Elastic IP: $IP"
    aws ec2 release-address --public-ip "$IP"
done
```

---

## 10. Schedule Resource Usage

### Why:
Turn off non-critical resources during off-hours.

### How:
Use AWS Instance Scheduler or Lambda functions.

#### Script Example: Stop Instances Outside Working Hours
```bash
# Stop all instances with a specific tag outside working hours
INSTANCES=$(aws ec2 describe-instances \
    --filters "Name=tag:Environment,Values=Dev" \
    --query "Reservations[*].Instances[*].InstanceId" --output text)

for INSTANCE in $INSTANCES; do
    echo "Stopping instance: $INSTANCE"
    aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids "$INSTANCE"
done
```
